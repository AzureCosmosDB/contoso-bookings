We live just a block from many great restaurants, and our go- to coffee shop \"St Marks\". There are restaurants all along 17th street! Just 5 blocks from both - City Park and Cheeseman Park, where we love to take the dogs, go for a run, rent a bike or paddle boat for an hour or so, or picnic on a summer sunday night to listen to live music. The Zoo and Botanic Gardens are in walking distance. During the summer months the Botanic Gardens hosts amazing, intimate concerts in their outdoor amphitheater. If you're here during this time you should check out their calendar. There are several other concert venues in close proximity, too. Less then a 10 minute commute to both Downtown Denver and Cherry Creek North or Cherry Creek Mall. Close to several other old town neighborhoods with small shops and tons of restaurants.",

I guess you could say I traded the beach for the mountains. You wouldn't think there would be much volleyball in the Mile High State but there is! The mountains are so close that it was also easy to pick up snowboarding again. \n\nDenver is the first place I ever lived in which I truly felt home. I hope you feel the same when you step into my humble abode.\n\nMy other favorite thing to do - travel. I enjoy exploring new cultures and immersing myself in them. Best thing I've seen so far - Northern Lights in Iceland and Alaska not to mention aerial trip to Denali! I'll send you some pics of them if you like :)\n\nI worked in hospitality for a large hotel chain for 14 years and have applied the knowledge and hotel standards to my Airbnb. I hope your experience in my home meets or exceeds expectations."

I love sharing my city with travelers and making new friends from around the country and the world.  I love hosting so much on Airbnb that I do it for others! \n\nI've had the opportunity to make lasting friendships through Airbnb and have traveled across the country and across the world to visit people who have stayed with me. My one tip for Airbnb guests is to read the house rules of the places you book. Each host is unique and when most of the upfront communication is done through reading, you need to read EVERYTHING on the listing. I've had more great experiences than bad, but my least stellar experiences with guests have been when they didn't read (or didn't respect) the house rules.\n\nTalk to you soon! "

As our family grew and our needs changed, we decided to rent out both of our two homes because neither one of us wanted to sell. We gave short term renting a try and we\u2019ve had such great experiences with the wonderful people we\u2019ve met. It brings joy to know that our guests are enjoying our homes as much as we did. \n\nAs a couple who travels quite a bit, we try to incorporate a high level of standards of what we expect in a hotel. Our ultimate goal and passion is to help our guests get as much out of their visit as possible, as there's just so much to offer in this unique and beautiful city. If there is anything that would make your stay more enjoyable, please reach out prior or during your stay. \n\n*I have contracted a translator for French and Spanish speaking guests to help arrange accommodations, if needed."

I came from the beautiful Finger Lakes area in upstate New York, moving here at 18 years old because I \"had never known until I came to Colorado that the sun could come out in winter. \"  That being the case, of course I never left. Lynne is from Colorado, with great-grandparents who grew up in Georgetown and old Snowmass. Life back then was not glamorous and a living was cobbled together from gritty pursuits such as silver mining.  \nWe love beautiful spaces, the outdoors, art in its many forms, and the company of good friends.  One of our careers together has been restoring neglected historic homes, and our home has been an almost two-decades long work in progress.  Restoring the apartment was one of our earlier efforts, and as is usually the case, we found architectural clues as to what our home's earlier owners had been up to.  (Such as the enormous beams that proved the claim that our house had been moved from Denver Municipal Airport in 1928. That airport became the old Stapleton Airport. We also heard from a gentleman in his ninties that he had watched it being moved.)\nWe believe historic homes are living history, in real time.  Having modern amenities makes them all the more appealing.\nPossibly our greatest love is travel.  We agree with St. Gus, who said \"The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.\" And of course our favorite part of traveling is and always will be connecting with people from all walks of life, from all around the world. We're so thankful to have the opportunity to do this once more through hosting. \nWishing you safe and happy travels! "

Because of the concentration of multi-family uses and the urban character of the neighborhood, parking is at a premium. The area is strongly influenced by the Colorado State Capitol and Downtown Denver which is adjacent to the northwest boundary of the neighborhood. Commercial uses are typically located on major arterials such as Colfax Avenue, East 8th Avenue, East 14th Avenue, East 13th Avenue, Lincoln Street and Broadway. A considerable number of mansion properties have been converted to office uses over the past several years due to zoning exemptions offered to historic structures which are zoned for residential uses.",

Neighbors are friendly and likely to greet you as you walk down the street. Parking is always available. Sirens are not common, and most cars drive safely through the \u2018hood. The disadvantage to Clayton is that it\u2019s so darn residential.  Without much to walk to, you will definitely want to consider having a car to get around. Busses come down the major streets and bikes are certainly an option -- but having your own vehicle would be preferable here. If you don\u2019t mind the quiet, check out Clayton.\"<br /><br />There's not much in close proximity as far as local eateries or grocery stores, but I do recommend Lucero's down the street for fab burritos and green chili, and the tamales at Tres Girasoles are also bomb.",

Also, there is so much culture, history, and nature to appreciate on the island as opposed to resorts whose only feature is the beach. Before buying this condo, we stayed at several of the other larger condo developments in Isla Verde. The building we chose is not as expansive as the others, but it has quicker beach access and is really in the best central location on the strip for access to restaurants, casinos, etc. "

I've visited most states in the US, 4 continents, 23 countries and counting.  Love everything I learn from traveling and experiencing new things.. but, a relaxing evening at home with friends and family really completes a trip, which is why I prefer an AirBnb stay over a hotel.  :-)"

        "neighborhood_overview": "Capitol Hill is Denver's most densely populated neighborhood. It was once the home of Denver's elite and origination of Foursquare architecture in Denver. Today it consists of historic mansions, apartments and condo buildings. Because of the concentration of multi-family uses and the urban character of the neighborhood, parking is at a premium. The area is strongly influenced by the Colorado State Capitol and Downtown Denver which is adjacent to the northwest boundary of the neighborhood. Commercial uses are typically located on major arterials such as Colfax Avenue, East 8th Avenue, East 14th Avenue, East 13th Avenue, Lincoln Street and Broadway. A considerable number of mansion properties have been converted to office uses over the past several years due to zoning exemptions offered to historic structures which are zoned for residential uses.",

And my husband is pretty great too!  He's a classically trained chef who just opened his own distillery, making small batch whiskey and gins.  \n\nMy bucket list is comprised mostly of the need to travel abroad.  I started traveling young, but haven't gotten away much in the last few years.  I desperately want to go to Italy, France, and Croatia.  Mostly because I love wine and food, and old buildings that have stories!\n\nI love to keep my carriage house spotless, and topped off with all the pleasantries I would want when traveling.  You may not see me much, but I am around if you need me.  I hope you enjoy the stay.\n\nA favorite quote of mine, by Hunter S. Thompson: \u201cLife should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming \"Wow!

My sister, Laurie, and I love to rent out our 2 homes on Airbnb to meet great people and to help fund our love of travel. \n\nI am originally from Kansas and moved to Denver almost 10 years ago.  I love all that Colorado has to offer.   In the summer I spend my time paddle boarding, camping and hiking.  In the winter you will find me on the ski slopes or in a mountain lodge by the fire.  I love exploring Denver with my friends who have become my family away from home.  \n\nI look forward to meeting guests from around the globe, thanks for checking out my listings!"

The rest is history.\n\nAs an adult, my trips range from weekend road trips to extended multi-month adventurers, for both work as a contracting AppleOS Software Engineer and/or pleasure in pursuit of athletic, cultural and educational endeavors.  \n\nAccommodations during my travels often require an independent, work-from-home and active lifestyle considerations, something I found not to be that readily available.  \n\nAfter acquiring a single family home in a mountain and ski resort town before the real estate bubble, and then several condominiums immediately after that bubble burst, I found myself in a position to setup and offer my properties and rooms in my house for that \"home office\" niche.\n\nFast forward to the internet era, and the embrace and popularity of airbnb.com and the like, I am now able to successfully manage these rental opportunities in an enjoyable and successful manner.  \"Who'da thunk\". this would have been possible as a youth lusting for travel?!\n\nI take pleasure in hosting my guests' stays at either my private condominiums and rooms in my home.  It's a great way for me to feel \"connected\" to that itinerant lifestyle while \"home'n it\".  \n\nI tend to float between these two locations to fathering my 6 year old son in Denver and/or managing rental turnovers.  \n\nI can \"hit the ground running\" at any of my properties with just a suitcase and gear in tow.  You will be able to as well.\n\nIn the interest of learning about your host, some hobbies I enjoy include home improvements, vintage vespas, photography/videography, technology, cooking, brewing beer/mead and volunteering.\n\nI could live just about anywhere, but I chose the endearing community of Steamboat Springs in the beautiful Yampa Valley and all it has to offer.  \n\nI'm more than happy to share my local knowledge and experiences with you during your extended  stay at my house in Steamboat, or at one of my other properties in Denver and Phoenix."

In July 2020 I also become owner and proprietor of a very cool property in Western Colorado currently hosting three tiny homes.\n\nBefore COVID I spent several long stretches of the year working as a Tour Director.  I lead small groups on wonderful vacations like \"Italy's Great Cities,\" or the \"Best of Spain.\" I also lead student groups to DC and NYC, and birthright tours to Israel.\n\nLong term travel is in my system.  I've spent years at a time in Morocco for the US Peace Corps and more years in each of Japan, Israel and Costa Rica working mostly as an English teacher and basketball coach.\n\nBetween the really long living abroad situations, I tried to see as much as I could see.  From the top bunk of a crowded boxcar on the Trans-Siberian Railway, to five-star hotels in Jerusalem I stayed everywhere.  Seeing the best and worst of accommodations, I learned to love the hospitality game.  \n\nIn 2014 I returned to Denver to became a family caregiver.  I began hosting a small family owned condo in Denver.  That little condo kept my pockets jingling and my mind spinning for four years.  So many problems!  Floods and bugs and drugs, Oh my!\n\nBut I worked that little listing, and I leveraged my hard-knock education into SuperHost status.  When it came time to trade up, I sold the condo and found this wonderful house in Denver.  I selected it specifically because I recognized its versatility as an AirBnB property.  \n\nThis home will forever be a work in progress.  It will never be perfect.  But it may be perfect for you!  I am an individual home owner and not a large conglomerate or property management company.  I'm working to improve and integrate new technology including dynamic pricing, limited automated messaging, and streamlining all my cleaning processes.\n\nWould love to have you see these little passion projects of mine.

We moved here because Denver is the perfect blend of everything we love:  during the day you can be in the mountains in 30 minutes and by nightfall you can be catching a show, eating and drinking at a hole in the wall gem or a fancy night out.\nWe love to be outside hiking, camping, cycling, climbing, or enjoying one of Denver's 250+ parks.  We also love all that Denver has to offer as far as nightlife -- everything from the ballet and theater to concerts at venues big and small, and we are huge foodies -- always searching for the best brunch and speakeasies.  We also just became parents in December of 2018 so we are adjusting to parent life and spending more time at home :-)\nWe have used Airbnb all over the country for both work and pleasure and are hoping to offer you what we feel like is the best experience.  We can be as hands-on or hands-off as you'd like.  Please feel free to reach out to us if you need anything at all, but we can also completely stay out of your hair if that's your flow as well.  We want you to feel at home in our quaint space but we also realize that sometimes all you need is a place to rest your head and you're out the door -- after all, you're here to take in all that Denver has to offer!"

Today, the lake isn\u2019t the neighborhood\u2019s only attraction, thanks to a slew of cultural additions. Shops and restaurants have turned part of West 29th Avenue into a walkable strip, while developments like the Lakehouse condo community on the former site of St. Anthony\u2019s Hospital are transforming the area near West Colfax. All you\u2019ll need to enjoy the neighborhood are some comfy shoes and an empty stomach.<br /><br />A construction boom has also characterized the Sloan's Lake neighborhood in recent years, with a flurry of both single-family homes and apartment units being built. Houses range from historical Victorian home plans to cozy bungalows, contemporary duplexes, and modern condos giving Sloan\u2019s Lake residents an eclectic neighborhood drive and homes for all tastes.<br /><br />Young professionals and young famil",

MBA Candidate at CU Denver. I am a passionate mountain lover, deep sea diver, photographer, and life explorer in the heart of Denver. When I am not getting lost in nature with my camera, you might find me creatively cooking up some meals in the kitchen with no recipes in sight. I live for meeting great people, eating savory food, adventuring with no agenda,  learning from others' stories and amazing places.\n \nI was born and raised in Denver, spent most of the last decade in New Zealand and now live back in my hometown. I take full advantage of my backyard by hiking, camping and skiing. In town, I venture out to live music, local bars, yoga and dance classes, photo galleries and supporting independent shops and restaurants. \n \nThis private flat is an urban sanctuary in the heart of Denver - a place to regroup and rejuvenate with lots of activities and delicious restaurants within walking distance. I am excited to host fellow adventurers, families, and friends and offer what so many people offered me while living abroad. \n\nSafe Travels x\nKalen\n\n \n \n\nMy Place and Neighborhood:\n\nMy place is a comfortable, modern and safe abode in the heart of Denver's most colorful urban  neighborhood! You will have the entire unit to yourselves- queen bed, king bed, and  there is a comfortable sleepable futon couch in the living room, private bath and large and well-stocked kitchen.  The fireplace is a bonus in the winter months.\n\nFrom the front door, you can take long or short walks admiring the historic Victorian bungalows and Arts and Crafts homes, gardens, and parks.

On Colfax you\u2019ll find a varied mix of coffee shops, restaurants, bars, music venues, yoga studios, cycling classes, film and record stores, and The Tattered Cover\u2014a large locally-owned bookstore in a converted movie theater. You\u2019ll also find tattoo parlors, photo-worthy graffiti walls, and plenty of gritty urban characters. As a photographer, my community never gets boring to document! You are just  a few blocks away from beautiful City Park with ponds and trails, the Denver Zoo, the Museum of Nature and Science, and the free Sunday \u201cJazz in the Park\u201d concerts during summer months. Walk to the Esplanade Farmers Market on Sunday mornings June-October (E Colfax and Columbine St). It\u2019s a wonderful neighborhood where just about anyone can find something to love. \n\n\n \n"

(I've been \"social distancing\" since '94 and 28K baud modems, so I know a thing or two about the now, near dominant work-from-home challenges, setup and rewards. ;) )  \n\nSince growing up in the small town of Eastern Pennsylvania called Nazareth, (Yeah, that's me, I am \"Joseph of Nazareth\"! ;P ), I have ventured through all 50 United States, and dozens of countries across North America, South America, Africa and Europe.  \n\nMy zest for travel stems from experiences in my youth attending grand and exciting \"Bon Voyage\" and \"Welcome Home\" parties, and trips to the airport, all dressed up, for family members to all of these unknown and distant places, in particular, Gram's many trips back to our mother country of Austria.  \n\nDuring my first international month long travels through Europe as a 17 year old, I enjoyed many a serendipitous guest house and hostel stay.  The rest is history.\n\nAs an adult, my trips range from weekend road trips to extended multi-month adventurers, for both work as a contracting AppleOS Software Engineer and/or pleasure in pursuit of athletic, cultural and educational endeavors.  \n\nAccommodations during my travels often require an independent, work-from-home and active lifestyle considerations, something I found not to be that readily available.  \n\nAfter acquiring a single family home in a mountain and ski resort town before the real estate bubble, and then several condominiums immediately after that bubble burst, I found myself in a position to setup and offer my properties and rooms in my house for that \"home office\" niche.\n\nFast forward to the internet era, and the embrace and popularity of airbnb.com and the like, I am now able to successfully manage these rental opportunities in an enjoyable and successful manner.  \"Who'da thunk\". this would have been possible as a youth lusting for travel?!\n\nI take pleasure in hosting my guests' stays at either my private condominiums and rooms in my home.  It's a great way for me to feel \"connected\" to that itinerant lifestyle while \"home'n it\".  \n\nI tend to float between these two locations to fathering my 6 year old son in Denver and/or managing rental turnovers.  \n\nI can \"hit the ground running\" at any of my properties with just a suitcase and gear in tow.  You will be able to as well.\n\nIn the interest of learning about your host, some hobbies I enjoy include home improvements, vintage vespas, photography/videography, technology, cooking, brewing beer/mead and volunteering.\n\nI could live just about anywhere, but I chose the endearing community of Steamboat Springs in the beautiful Yampa Valley and all it has to offer.  \n\nI'm more than happy to share my local knowledge and experiences with you during your extended  stay at my house in Steamboat, or at one of my other properties in Denver and Phoenix."

We are both Superhosts and have even launched a Udemy course on how to be a terrific Airbnb host! \n\nIf there is one website that has truly changed my life, it is Airbnb. \n\nNow we own properties in some of the places we love the most, including Denver, Colorado --- Steamboat Springs, Colorado --- and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. We call all of these places \u201chome\u201d and work hard to create an experience for our guests that has all of the conveniences of home but all the pleasures of being on a holiday. \n\nThe Airbnb community is so important to us and has helped us fulfill our dreams.
