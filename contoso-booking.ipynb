MBA Candidate at CU Denver. I am a passionate mountain lover, deep sea diver, photographer, and life explorer in the heart of Denver. When I am not getting lost in nature with my camera, you might find me creatively cooking up some meals in the kitchen with no recipes in sight. I live for meeting great people, eating savory food, adventuring with no agenda,  learning from others' stories and amazing places.\\n \\nI was born and raised in Denver, spent most of the last decade in New Zealand and now live back in my hometown. I take full advantage of my backyard by hiking, camping and skiing. In town, I venture out to live music, local bars, yoga and dance classes, photo galleries and supporting independent shops and restaurants. \\n \\nThis private flat is an urban sanctuary in the heart of Denver - a place to regroup and rejuvenate with lots of activities and delicious restaurants within walking distance.

You’ll also find tattoo parlors, photo-worthy graffiti walls, and plenty of gritty urban characters. As a photographer, my community never gets boring to document! You are just  a few blocks away from beautiful City Park with ponds and trails, the Denver Zoo, the Museum of Nature and Science, and the free Sunday “Jazz in the Park” concerts during summer months.
