## Real-Time AirBnB Property Search with Location and Text-based Filters
Use a dataset of airbnb listings with associated descriptions and geospatial metadata (longitude/ latitude). Combine spatial filtering (find properties in a specific area) with text-based search (e.g., "garden", "3 bedrooms")/ semantic search.
 
the only on vCore pitch is that you can combine geospatial and text filters with your semantic search. which mongo doesnt support today
